## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
Having 2 equal divs side by side in one div container. Code is shown below:

```css
.productCard {
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  width: 40rem;
  min-height: 25rem;
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
  margin: 2rem;
}

.productImg {
  flex: 50%;
  background: url(images/image-product-desktop.jpg) center/cover no-repeat;
  max-width: 100%;
  border-radius: 0.5rem 0 0 0.5rem;
}

.productInfo {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: space-between;
  flex: 45%;
  padding: 5%; /*Border-box=> 45%+5%=50%*/
  word-wrap: break-word;
}
```

### Continued development

I need to practice more with image scaling on different devices
